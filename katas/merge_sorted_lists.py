To complete this exercise:
--------------------------
Try to be as efficient as you can - don't use Python's built in sort() or sorted() functions!


Exercise Breakdown:
-------------------
`sort()` - Sorts a list in-place, meaning it sorts the original list and does not return a new one.
`sorted()` - Sorts the list but returns a new list with the elements sorted, leaving the original iterable unchanged.
